# NBA Chatbot Prototype

Welcome to the **NBA Chatbot Prototype** repository! This project is a proof of concept for an interactive chatbot designed to answer questions and provide insights about the NBA. 

The chatbot leverages a **modular, agent-based architecture**, offering flexibility to integrate various large language models (LLMs) or other AI tools without being tied to a specific implementation.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Agent-Oriented Design**  
  A dynamic system where agents collaborate to process queries and generate accurate, context-aware responses about NBA topics.

- **LLM Agnostic**  
  The architecture is designed to work with a wide range of LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic), enabling easy experimentation and optimization.

- **Extensible Framework**  
  Ready to integrate additional functionalities like:
  - Player stats  
  - Team histories  
  - Live game updates
  - Advanced analytics  

- **Prototype Utilities**  
  Core functionality includes understanding and responding to questions about:
  - NBA players  
  - Teams  
  - Games  
  - Statistics

## 🎯 Goals

This project aims to:
1. Test and refine the multi-agent workflow.
2. Evaluate performance with different LLMs or model combinations.
3. Gather feedback for developing a production-level NBA chatbot.
